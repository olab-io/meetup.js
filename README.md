# Weekly JavaScript Meet-ups at SAIC
This repo contains the materials, notes, and example code from our weekly JavaScript meet-ups.

### Week 1 - 2

__What is JavaScript?__

A brief history of web scripting: the Java applet, Flash, and now JS.

__Basics__

1. HTML + CSS + JS
2. The browser as a context for running JavaScript
3. How code is run (top to bottom)
4. Writing JavaScript in Sublime text, `.html` and `.js` files, and `//comments`
5. Variable types: `boolean`, `int`, `float`, `char`, `string`, `array`, `Object`, and `functions`
6. The `Object`: properties, methods, and `json` 
7. Variable scope (global vs local)
8. Logging and using the console
9. Rendering to the browser and DOM manipulation (with jQuery)
